# Value_Interpretable_Dynamic_Treatment_Regimes
Given modelling parameters for a Markov Decision Process, we present a greedy method to obtain intepretable tree based policies. We observe that the state space is given by a disjoint union of boxes for which we create a data structure to store. Under appropriate tightness conditions we obtain an optimization of the algorithm. 

We also present ideas of scaling this approach under tightness assumptions
